Design: Correctness (40 points)
------

> 1. How do you parallelize the compression process to maximize the underlying physical resources (i.e., CPUs)? 
>    - How did you determine the number of threads to use for the wpzip?  (4 points)
>    - How did you break down the compression process into different tasks?  (4 points) 
>    - What are those tasks? (4 points)
>    - Which tasks were parallelized and which are serial? (4 points)

Response.

> 2. How did you employ concurrency mechanisms to ensure correctness, avoid deadlocks, and coordinate threads?
>    - What synchronization primitives (mutex, condition variables, semaphores) did you use? (4 points)
>    - How was each primitive used? (6 points)
>    - Justify how your design ensures correctness. (10 points)
>    - How did you design to maximize the parallelism? (4 points)

Responses.


> 3. Additional design details that are not covered in the previous two questions. 

Responses.



Performance Optimization (10 points)
------

> 1. What optimizations have you tried and which optimizations were useful in improving the compression performance over your previous parallelized implementation?

Responses.

> 2. Description of any new workloads you used to understand the performance bottlenecks.

Responses.

Errata
------

> Describe any known errors, bugs, or deviations from the requirements.
